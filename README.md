this small code will export an fbx with only meshes (no armature, no animations) if you select only meshes. it will export meshes with armature but no animation if you select meshes and armatures, and it will export only armature and animation if you select only the armatures. usefull for exporting to game engines. I assigned it to a shortcut, and it saves a lot of time me when I am "in the flow"  
feel free to used however
